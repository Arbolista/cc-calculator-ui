# Cool Climate Calculator UI

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/AnalyticsFire/spike.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/CoolClimate/cc-calculator-ui)

## Purpose

Spike is collection of Javascript modules, compilers, and libraries intended to ease development of front end applications that interact with web services. Dependencies include:
- [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)
- [React Templates](http://wix.github.io/react-templates/)
- [ReactJs History](https://github.com/mjackson/history) - JS framework agnostic
- [Babel with ES2015 support](https://babeljs.io/docs/learn-es2015/)
- [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) and jQuery for UI prototyping.
- [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) - for compiling client assets
- [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io/0.13/index.html) and [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) for testing

Spike uses these dependencies to implement the following features within a well defined architecture:
- Polymorphic models and state manager framework to retrieve data on the server or the client.
- Server side rendering on Express server - bypasses initial render and data retrieval on client.
- Client side management of browser history (ie routing).
- Webpack development server for fast and easy development of changes through hot loading.
- Webpack configuration for environment based API calls (see `client/api/{env}`).
- Standalone Webpack builds for offline development of HTML and CSS by designers.
- Karma and Jasmine configurations to test app rendering on both client and server.
- ESLint configuration to ensure consistent code style with Spike base.

## Scripts

Install dependencies
```
npm install
```

## Generating components

Generate component named Super
```
npm run generate -- --component Super
```

This will copy and process a set of files in ./client/config/templates/component
and put it into ./client/components/super directory

To specify a different subdirectory use --destination switch with subdirectory name relative to ./client/components/

```
npm run generate -- --component SubSuper --destination super/sub_super
```

This will generate set of component files inside of ./client/components/super/sub_super/.


## Developing

To run the Webpack development server,

```sh
npm run develop
```

## Testing

`npm test` is equivalent to:

```
BABEL_DISABLE_CACHE=1 karma start --single-run
BABEL_DISABLE_CACHE=1 babel-node test.server.js
eslint --fix .
```

Karma is used to test client side application interactions.

Jasmine is used to test that the application successfully renders server side for a given URL (using [supertest](https://github.com/visionmedia/supertest) to mock requests).

## Design Build

Build the app with webpack:

```sh
npm run build_design
```

The design app requires no backend, just a server so files can be downloaded with jQuery. For instance with Python or Python3:

```
cd client/build/design
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
python3 -m http.server
```

*Note*
In order for the design build to work, every rendered component should have a class level `NAME` which is unique and the same as the name used to import the component in the templates.

## Internationalization

In order to internationalize the component it must inherit from TranslatableComponent.

This parent class provides child components with `t` property that
can be called in templates as `this.t('Some string')` and with `i18next` property that is uninitialized in test environment.

Translations can be found in ./server/assets/translation/{lngCode}.json and it is in following format:

```json
{
  "This is a key to be translated.": "Ovo je kljuƒç koji treba prevesti."
}
```

Setup uses gettext type keys - so if key is missing library will fallback on the key. Translation is turned off in test environments.

Language detection uses URL, and stores information in `lang` cookie.
You can change language by appending `lang=LANGUAGE_CODE` to query string of the URL (eg. `lang=bs`).

## Areas for Improvement

Currently, any changes made to React templates are not seen by Webpack's watcher, so you have to force a change in the React component class for Webpack to load the changes in your template files.

The alternative is to set `cache: false` in the development webpack configuration file. However, this dramatically slows down hot patching.
